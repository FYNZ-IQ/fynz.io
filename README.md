This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Onboarding wizard

All subscribe CTAs route to `/onboarding`, a wizard that collects the new
customer's brand and business details and posts them to the onboarding bridge
(`services/onboarding-bridge`), which writes them into the buyer's GHL
sub-account. Because this site is a static export, the browser calls the
bridge directly — set the bridge's base URL at build time:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARDING_BRIDGE_URL=https://your-bridge-host pnpm build
```

The bridge must list this site's origin in its `PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGINS` env var
(see `services/onboarding-bridge/README.md`). If the variable is unset, the
wizard renders but submissions show a "not wired up" error with a mailto
fallback.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
